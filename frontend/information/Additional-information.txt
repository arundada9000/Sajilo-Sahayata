How Can you run it ?

easy download both backend and frontend in separate or same folder.
open each folder directory and run
npm install
everything will be installed 
then run in both 
num run dev

How it works : 
Mainly we work with Geo-location ,based on your current location sajilo-sahayata will find your local government and whenever you report or go to sahayata call , it will provide information from your own local government ,making it easier to report and take action for both victims and rescuers. 

A nice dashboard for admin to manage users, alerts and reports.
Real time reporting using power of nodejs.
