📦 Problem:
- react-leaflet-cluster does not support React 19 (only React 17 & 18 in peerDependencies).
- This causes Vercel build to fail.
- Downgrading React is not acceptable.

✅ Goal:
- Keep React 19.
- Patch react-leaflet-cluster.
- Deploy successfully to Vercel.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix:

1. Install patch-package:
   npm install patch-package postinstall-postinstall --save-dev

2. Generate a patch for react-leaflet-cluster:
   npx patch-package react-leaflet-cluster

3. Edit the created patch file in /patches:
   File: patches/react-leaflet-cluster+<version>.patch

   Inside it, locate:
     "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0",

   Change it to:
     "peerDependencies": {
       "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",

4. Add this to package.json:
   "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "patch-package"
   }

5. Push to GitHub (make sure to include /patches folder in repo)

6. Deploy to Vercel — it will:
   - Run npm install
   - Run postinstall script
   - Apply patch
   - Build and deploy ✅

📌 Tip: Run `npm ci` locally to simulate a clean Vercel build.

“When I’m ready, help me reapply the React 19 patch fix for react-leaflet-cluster and Vercel using patch-package.”
